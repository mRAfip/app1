# Banner Image Setup

## 📁 **Place Your Banner Image Here**

1. **Add your banner image** to this folder: `assets/images/banner.png`
2. **Recommended dimensions**: 1080x600 or similar aspect ratio
3. **File format**: PNG, JPG, or WebP
4. **File name**: Must be `banner.png` (or update the code to match your filename)

## 🎨 **Image Requirements**

- **High resolution**: For crisp display on all devices
- **Aspect ratio**: 16:9 or similar for best header coverage
- **File size**: Keep under 2MB for fast loading
- **Content**: Should work well with white text overlay

## 🔄 **After Adding Your Image**

The app will automatically use your local banner image instead of the placeholder.

## 📱 **Current Setup**

The app is configured to look for:
- `assets/images/banner.png` (local file)
- Falls back to placeholder if not found
